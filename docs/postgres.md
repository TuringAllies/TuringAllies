## How to tell if PostgresQL is currently on your machine

- navigate to Terminal (or command line app that you use)
- type `psql`
- if you see something similar to `michaelmarchand=#` in your Terminal, than you have PostgresQL properly installed in your machine and do not need to read any more of this document.
- if you see something similar to `command not found`, then you must install PostgresQL on your machine.

## How to get PostgresQL on your machine

PostgreSQL is a database system. It is one option to interact with an SQL database.

There are many "systems" that can be used to interact with SQL databases.

MySQL, SQLite, PostgreSQL, are a few examples of database "systems".

All SQL database "systems" have the ability to create a database, database tables, and database table records using SQL.

Each "system" is a little different than the other. Though unless you're spending significant amounts of time writing SQL queries (you most likely won't be, at least not right now) it may be helpful to think of all these "systems" as being the same.

PostgreSQL is the most prominently used database "system". If you approach these "systems" as simply being a way to use SQL, then that's the most significant difference you need to articulate at this time.

Here is the [PostgreSQL homepage](https://www.postgresql.org/)

You can spend as much time there as you'd like on your own

If you simply want to get it installed on your machine:

1. click [Download](https://www.postgresql.org/download/)
2. select your Operating System (Mac, or Windows, or something else)
3. Choose one of the methods to install PostgreSQL. I use Homebrew on my Mac to install important pieces of software
