We believe sobriety is a spectrum of sober, sober curious people and those who live consciously. Club Soda is exclusive without excluding. If other dating apps have felt too superficial, too chaotic, or just too drunk, Club Soda is for you!
 
Our Story:

The Club Soda story began in October of 2016 on the island of Savu Savu, Fiji, where our founder Jennique Mason was celebrating her birthday with a girlfriend. Sipping club sodas (with lime, natch) on the beach one evening, the two swapped horror stories about trying to meet people without dating culture’s favorite social lubricant. They realized they face the same issues: most people’s first suggestion was to meet at a bar, often strangers questioned their lifestyle choices before they even met and that sometimes, dates just showed up already drunk! These shared experiences begged the question: why isn’t there an app for people who want to date conscious rather than blacked out?",http://www.meetclubsoda.com,Dating App,1-100
